# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone graded module works and projects on SpaceX API with COURSERA.ORG
This capstone project course will give me a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. I will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.
